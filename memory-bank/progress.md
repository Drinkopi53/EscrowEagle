The `spesifikasi-produk.md` (Local Simulation Version) has been successfully validated, marking a significant milestone. Furthermore, the foundational elements of the local simulation project have been successfully initialized, including the monorepo structure, Next.js application, Hardhat project, Python oracle script framework, and initial dummy data files. This comprehensive setup provides a robust base for further development.
